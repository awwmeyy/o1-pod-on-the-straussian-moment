  ### **Chapter 8: René Girard and the Theory of Mimetic Desire**

  **[Soft transitional music fades in and then out]**

  **John:** Welcome back to "Philosophy Unveiled." In our previous segment, we explored Leo Strauss's call for a return to fundamental questions and classical philosophy as a means to address modern challenges. Now, we're going to delve into the intriguing world of René Girard and his theory of mimetic desire. We'll examine how Girard's ideas contribute to our understanding of human nature, violence, and social cohesion, and how they intersect with the themes we've been discussing from Peter Thiel's "The Straussian Moment."

  **Emily:** That's right, John. René Girard was a French literary critic and philosopher whose work spanned literature, anthropology, sociology, and theology. His theory of mimetic desire offers a profound explanation of human behavior and the roots of conflict.

  **John:** Girard's central idea is that human desire is imitative or "mimetic." In other words, we learn what to desire by observing the desires of others. This imitation goes beyond simple copying; it's a fundamental mechanism that shapes our relationships and societies.

  **Emily:** Let's start by unpacking the concept of mimetic desire. According to Girard, unlike basic needs such as hunger or thirst, our desires for objects, status, or relationships are not purely spontaneous or individual. We desire things because others desire them, creating a triangle of desire involving the subject, the model, and the object.

  **John:** Exactly. For example, a child might desire a toy not because of its inherent qualities but because another child is playing with it. This can lead to rivalry and competition as individuals vie for the same objects or status symbols.

  **Emily:** Girard suggests that this mimetic rivalry is a fundamental source of conflict in human societies. As individuals imitate each other's desires, they become rivals, which can escalate into aggression and violence.

  **John:** To prevent societies from descending into chaos due to these rivalries, Girard introduces the concept of the scapegoat mechanism. This is a process by which communities channel their collective aggression onto a single individual or group, blaming them for the community's problems.

  **Emily:** The scapegoat is often an outsider or someone perceived as different. By uniting against this common enemy, the community restores harmony and resolves internal tensions—at least temporarily.

  **John:** This mechanism is deeply rooted in human history and culture. Girard points out that many myths, rituals, and religious practices revolve around sacrifice and the expulsion of a scapegoat figure.

  **Emily:** For instance, ancient societies might have performed ritual sacrifices to appease the gods and prevent disasters. Girard interprets these practices as manifestations of the scapegoat mechanism at work.

  **John:** Importantly, Girard argues that the scapegoat is typically innocent, but the community believes in their guilt. This collective belief justifies the violence against the scapegoat and allows the community to feel a sense of catharsis.

  **Emily:** Girard's theory also extends to how cultures and religions evolve. He suggests that the Judeo-Christian tradition, particularly the story of Jesus Christ, reveals and challenges the scapegoat mechanism.

  **John:** In the crucifixion of Jesus, the innocence of the scapegoat is exposed. Unlike previous myths where the scapegoat's guilt is assumed, the Gospels emphasize Jesus's innocence, thus undermining the legitimacy of the scapegoat mechanism.

  **Emily:** This revelation has profound implications. It brings awareness to the cycle of violence and the unjust persecution of individuals. Girard believes that this awareness can lead to the dismantling of the scapegoat mechanism in society.

  **John:** However, with the collapse of this mechanism, societies lose a traditional means of resolving internal conflicts. Without the scapegoat mechanism, mimetic rivalries can escalate unchecked, leading to greater potential for widespread violence.

  **Emily:** Girard refers to this as the "apocalyptic" potential of modern society. He doesn't mean apocalypse in the sense of a supernatural end but as a revelation and unmasking of human violence that could lead to self-destruction if not addressed.

  **John:** So, how does Girard propose we deal with this dilemma? He emphasizes the need for forgiveness, empathy, and the renunciation of mimetic rivalry. By recognizing our tendencies toward imitation and rivalry, we can consciously choose to break the cycle.

  **Emily:** This involves cultivating a sense of humility and understanding, acknowledging our shared vulnerabilities, and embracing compassion over competition.

  **John:** Now, let's connect Girard's ideas to the broader themes in Thiel's essay. Thiel suggests that modern liberalism, with its focus on individualism and economic interests, fails to account for the deep-rooted mechanisms of mimetic desire and the potential for violence they entail.

  **Emily:** Exactly. By overlooking the role of imitation and rivalry in human behavior, liberal societies may underestimate the forces that can lead to conflict, both internally and externally.

  **John:** For instance, the spread of extremist ideologies can be seen through the lens of mimetic desire. Individuals may imitate the desires and actions of charismatic leaders or peer groups, leading to radicalization and violence.

  **Emily:** Additionally, the breakdown of traditional structures and shared narratives in modern societies can exacerbate feelings of competition and rivalry. Without common values or purposes, mimetic desires may become more fragmented and volatile.

  **John:** Girard's insights suggest that addressing these challenges requires more than economic solutions or policy adjustments. It calls for a deeper understanding of human nature and the mechanisms that drive conflict.

  **Emily:** This aligns with our previous discussions about the importance of revisiting fundamental questions and integrating insights from classical philosophy and other traditions.

  **John:** By acknowledging the role of mimetic desire, societies can develop strategies to mitigate rivalry. This might involve promoting collaborative environments, emphasizing shared goals, and fostering empathy.

  **Emily:** Education plays a crucial role here. Teaching individuals about mimetic desire and its effects can increase self-awareness and reduce the likelihood of unconscious imitation leading to conflict.

  **John:** Furthermore, creating spaces for open dialogue and reconciliation can help address grievances that might otherwise fuel rivalries.

  **Emily:** Girard's emphasis on forgiveness and reconciliation resonates with many religious and philosophical traditions. It underscores the potential for transformation and healing in human relationships.

  **John:** However, implementing these ideas on a societal scale is challenging. It requires collective commitment and a shift in cultural attitudes.

  **Emily:** Indeed. There may also be resistance from those who benefit from perpetuating rivalries or who are deeply entrenched in cycles of imitation and competition.

  **John:** So, how can leaders and policymakers apply Girard's insights to address contemporary issues like terrorism, political polarization, and social unrest?

  **Emily:** One approach is to focus on conflict resolution and peacebuilding initiatives that prioritize understanding and addressing underlying causes rather than merely suppressing symptoms.

  **John:** This might involve engaging with marginalized communities, addressing systemic injustices, and promoting inclusive narratives that reduce the appeal of scapegoating.

  **Emily:** Additionally, media and cultural institutions can play a role by promoting stories and representations that highlight cooperation, diversity, and mutual respect.

  **John:** It's also important to recognize the influence of technology and social media in amplifying mimetic desires. Online platforms can accelerate the spread of imitation and rivalry, sometimes leading to viral conflicts.

  **Emily:** Developing digital literacy and promoting responsible use of technology can help mitigate these effects. Encouraging critical thinking and reflection can reduce impulsive imitation.

  **John:** Girard's theory also invites us to reflect on our personal lives. By becoming aware of our own mimetic desires, we can make conscious choices about what we value and how we relate to others.

  **Emily:** This self-awareness can lead to more authentic relationships and reduce unnecessary competition. It can also foster a sense of inner peace and fulfillment.

  **John:** Returning to Thiel's essay, the integration of Girard's ideas highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior in political and social theories.

  **Emily:** It suggests that addressing the challenges of the modern world requires engaging with the deeper psychological and anthropological aspects of humanity.

  **John:** By combining insights from thinkers like Girard, Strauss, Schmitt, and Locke, we can develop a more nuanced framework for understanding and addressing the complexities of human societies.

  **Emily:** This multidisciplinary approach can inform policies and practices that promote stability, peace, and well-being.

  **John:** Before we conclude this segment, let's consider potential critiques of Girard's theory.

  **Emily:** One critique is that Girard's model may overemphasize the role of mimetic desire and scapegoating, potentially oversimplifying the multifaceted causes of conflict.

  **John:** Additionally, some argue that his theory doesn't fully account for structural factors like economic inequalities, political power dynamics, and historical contexts.

  **Emily:** It's important to integrate Girard's insights with other analyses to capture the full picture of societal issues.

  **John:** Absolutely. No single theory can explain all aspects of human behavior, but Girard's contributions offer valuable perspectives that can enhance our understanding.

  **Emily:** As we move forward, we can consider how these ideas interact with other philosophical approaches and what practical steps can be taken to apply them.

  **John:** In our next segment, we'll explore the debate between Strauss and Girard, examining their differing views on knowledge, society, and the potential for resolving the challenges we've discussed.

  **Emily:** We'll delve into how their perspectives converge and diverge, and what this means for our quest to find solutions to modern dilemmas.

  **John:** It's sure to be an engaging and thought-provoking discussion, so stay tuned as we continue our journey through "The Straussian Moment."
