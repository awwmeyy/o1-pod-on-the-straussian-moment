  ### **Chapter 4: The Abandonment of Fundamental Questions in Modern Philosophy**

  **[Soft transitional music fades in and then out]**

  **Emily:** Welcome back to "Philosophy Unveiled." In our last segment, we discussed the limitations of economic incentives in containing violence, as highlighted by Peter Thiel in "The Straussian Moment." Now, let's delve into another critical theme of his essay: the abandonment of fundamental questions in modern philosophy and how this shift has impacted our society.

  **John:** That's right, Emily. Thiel argues that modern political philosophy, particularly since the Enlightenment, has moved away from addressing deep, existential questions about human nature, purpose, and the good life. Instead, it has focused primarily on reason, individual rights, and economic considerations.

  **Emily:** Exactly. He suggests that by neglecting these foundational inquiries, we've created a vacuum that leaves us ill-equipped to understand and address complex issues like ideological extremism and cultural conflicts.

  **John:** So, let's begin by exploring how this shift occurred. The Enlightenment was a period that emphasized reason, science, and individualism. Thinkers like John Locke, Immanuel Kant, and Voltaire championed the idea that human beings are rational actors capable of governing themselves through reason.

  **Emily:** This was a significant departure from the earlier philosophical traditions that grappled with questions about the nature of virtue, the purpose of life, and humanity's place in the cosmos. Classical philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, as well as religious thinkers like Augustine and Aquinas, saw these questions as central to understanding human existence.

  **John:** Thiel points out that the modern emphasis on reason and empirical knowledge led to the marginalization of these deeper questions. The belief was that by focusing on what could be observed and measured, society could progress more effectively.

  **Emily:** However, this approach had unintended consequences. By sidelining discussions about meaning, purpose, and morality, modern philosophy may have stripped individuals and societies of the tools needed to navigate existential dilemmas.

  **John:** Exactly. And when events occur that can't be adequately explained or addressed through reason and economic analysis alone—such as acts of terrorism driven by ideological fervor—we find ourselves at a loss.

  **Emily:** Thiel argues that this is because we've lost touch with the aspects of human nature that don't fit neatly into rational or economic frameworks. By ignoring the non-material dimensions of human existence, we've limited our understanding of what motivates people.

  **John:** This brings us to the dichotomy between Athens and Jerusalem—a metaphor Thiel uses to represent the philosophical traditions of reason and faith, respectively.

  **Emily:** Yes, Athens symbolizes the tradition of rational inquiry and philosophical reasoning, stemming from ancient Greek philosophers. Jerusalem represents the tradition of faith, spirituality, and religious understanding, rooted in Judeo-Christian thought.

  **John:** Historically, Western civilization has been shaped by the interplay between these two traditions. They often existed in tension but also complemented each other, providing a holistic approach to understanding human nature and society.

  **Emily:** However, with the rise of modernity and the Enlightenment, there was a deliberate move away from the Jerusalem aspect. Religion and faith were increasingly seen as obstacles to progress and were relegated to the private sphere.

  **John:** This secularization aimed to prevent conflicts like the religious wars that ravaged Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The idea was that by removing religion from public life, societies could avoid sectarian violence.

  **Emily:** While this approach had its benefits, Thiel suggests that it also led to a neglect of the profound questions that religion and spirituality address—questions about meaning, morality, and the ultimate purpose of human life.

  **John:** Without engaging with these questions, individuals may struggle to find a sense of identity and purpose, which can make them vulnerable to extremist ideologies that offer clear answers and a sense of belonging.

  **Emily:** That's a key point. In the absence of meaningful engagement with fundamental questions, people may seek out alternative narratives that provide the certainty and purpose they're lacking.

  **John:** So, what does Thiel propose? He suggests that we need to reintegrate these fundamental questions into our philosophical and political discourse. This doesn't mean abandoning reason or the achievements of modernity but rather acknowledging that reason alone is insufficient.

  **Emily:** Exactly. It's about finding a balance between Athens and Jerusalem—between rational inquiry and the exploration of meaning and purpose. By doing so, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of human nature.

  **John:** Let's consider how this might look in practice. For example, in education, we could encourage curricula that not only focus on STEM subjects and critical thinking but also on philosophy, ethics, and comparative religion.

  **Emily:** This would allow students to grapple with questions about what it means to live a good life, how to discern right from wrong, and how to understand different cultural and religious perspectives.

  **John:** In public discourse, it might involve creating spaces where discussions about values, morality, and purpose are welcomed rather than dismissed as purely personal or irrelevant.

  **Emily:** Thiel also references the work of philosophers like Leo Strauss, who advocated for a return to classical political philosophy. Strauss believed that modernity had led us away from essential truths about human nature and society.

  **John:** Strauss argued that by revisiting the works of classical philosophers, we could rediscover these truths and apply them to contemporary challenges.

  **Emily:** However, Strauss was cautious about how this knowledge was disseminated. He believed that some truths were dangerous if widely known and should be communicated esoterically—that is, in a way that only a select few could understand.

  **John:** This raises interesting ethical questions about elitism and transparency. Is it appropriate to withhold certain knowledge from the public for fear of its potential misuse?

  **Emily:** It's a contentious issue. On one hand, shielding certain ideas might prevent misunderstandings or misapplications. On the other hand, it can be seen as undemocratic and paternalistic.

  **John:** Thiel seems to suggest that while there may be risks, engaging openly with fundamental questions is necessary for the health of society. Avoiding these discussions may leave us unprepared for challenges that require deep understanding.

  **Emily:** Agreed. By confronting these questions directly, we can develop more resilient societies that are better equipped to handle ideological conflicts and existential threats.

  **John:** This also involves recognizing the limitations of secular liberalism. While it has provided many benefits, it may not fully address the human need for meaning and community.

  **Emily:** So, reintegrating discussions about virtue, the good life, and the nature of humanity could help fill this gap. It might also provide alternative narratives to counter extremist ideologies.

  **John:** It's important to note that this doesn't mean imposing a particular set of beliefs on others. Rather, it's about creating a culture where diverse perspectives on fundamental questions are explored and respected.

  **Emily:** Exactly. Encouraging open dialogue and critical reflection can foster mutual understanding and reduce the appeal of simplistic or extremist narratives.

  **John:** Another aspect Thiel touches on is the role of technology and how it can both connect and alienate us. In a world increasingly mediated by technology, we may lose touch with the deeper aspects of human connection and community.

  **Emily:** This can exacerbate feelings of isolation and meaninglessness, making individuals more susceptible to radicalization.

  **John:** Therefore, addressing the abandonment of fundamental questions also involves examining how technology shapes our lives and relationships.

  **Emily:** We might consider how to use technology to foster genuine connections and facilitate meaningful discussions, rather than allowing it to create echo chambers or superficial interactions.

  **John:** Thiel's critique invites us to reflect on how modern philosophy and society have evolved and whether we've lost something valuable along the way.

  **Emily:** It challenges us to consider whether a re-engagement with fundamental questions could help us address the root causes of contemporary issues.

  **John:** So, how do we begin this re-engagement? One approach is to encourage philosophical education and discourse at all levels of society.

  **Emily:** This includes not only academic settings but also public forums, media, and even within families and communities.

  **John:** We can promote literature, art, and culture that grapple with existential themes, helping people explore these questions in accessible ways.

  **Emily:** Additionally, policymakers and leaders can model this engagement by incorporating philosophical considerations into their decision-making processes.

  **John:** It's about recognizing that technical solutions alone are insufficient. We need to address the human element—the values, beliefs, and aspirations that drive behavior.

  **Emily:** By doing so, we can create policies and initiatives that resonate more deeply with people's needs and motivations.

  **John:** This holistic approach could lead to more effective strategies for combating extremism, fostering social cohesion, and promoting well-being.

  **Emily:** It's a challenging endeavor, but one that holds the promise of a more integrated and understanding society.

  **John:** As we move forward, we'll explore how other thinkers, such as Carl Schmitt and René Girard, contribute to this discussion and what insights they offer.

  **Emily:** We'll examine Schmitt's critique of liberalism and his emphasis on the inherent conflicts in politics, as well as Girard's theory of mimetic desire and the scapegoat mechanism.

  **John:** These perspectives will help us understand the complexities of human behavior and social dynamics, providing additional tools for addressing contemporary challenges.

  **Emily:** Before we conclude this segment, I'd like to reflect on the practical implications of re-engaging with fundamental questions.

  **John:** Please go ahead.

  **Emily:** In our personal lives, taking time to contemplate our values and purpose can lead to greater fulfillment and clarity. It can help us make decisions that align with our deepest convictions.

  **John:** In communities, fostering open discussions about meaning and ethics can strengthen bonds and promote mutual respect.

  **Emily:** And at the societal level, incorporating these considerations into education and policy can create a more cohesive and resilient social fabric.

  **John:** It's about recognizing that humans are not just economic actors but beings with complex emotional, spiritual, and intellectual dimensions.

  **Emily:** By addressing these dimensions, we can create environments where individuals feel valued and connected, reducing the allure of extremist ideologies.

  **John:** Thiel's call to revisit fundamental questions is both a critique and an invitation—a challenge to expand our horizons and deepen our understanding.

  **Emily:** It's a timely message, especially in an era where rapid technological and social changes can leave people feeling unmoored.

  **John:** As we continue our exploration, let's keep these ideas in mind and consider how they might inform our responses to the challenges we face.

  **Emily:** Agreed. In our next segment, we'll delve into John Locke's contributions to modern liberalism and examine both the strengths and limitations of his philosophy.

  **John:** We'll explore how Locke's ideas have shaped our current political and social structures and what insights they offer for navigating today's complexities.

  **Emily:** So stay tuned as we continue this journey through "The Straussian Moment" and its profound implications.
