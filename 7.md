  ### **Chapter 6: Carl Schmitt's Challenge to Liberalism**

  **[Soft transitional music fades in and then out]**

  **John:** Welcome back to "Philosophy Unveiled." In our previous discussion, we delved into John Locke's contributions to modern liberalism and considered both the strengths and limitations of his philosophy. Now, let's turn our attention to a thinker who presents a stark challenge to liberal ideals: Carl Schmitt. We'll explore his critique of liberalism and discuss how his ideas contrast with those of Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers.

  **Emily:** That's right, John. Carl Schmitt was a German legal and political theorist known for his controversial views and his critique of liberal democracy. His work is provocative and, at times, unsettling, but it's important to engage with his ideas to understand the challenges they pose to liberal thought.

  **John:** Indeed. Schmitt's central concept revolves around the idea of "the political" and the inherent conflicts within political life. He argues that politics is fundamentally about the distinction between friends and enemies, and that liberalism's emphasis on neutrality and individual rights fails to account for this basic reality.

  **Emily:** Let's begin by unpacking Schmitt's definition of "the political." For Schmitt, the essence of politics is the possibility of conflict, specifically the existential struggle between groups that identify each other as enemies. This friend-enemy distinction is the defining feature of political identity.

  **John:** Exactly. He asserts that all genuine political actions and motives can be traced back to this distinction. In other words, politics is not about consensus or compromise but about the potential for conflict and the readiness to confront existential threats.

  **Emily:** This stands in stark contrast to liberalism, which seeks to minimize conflict through laws, institutions, and the protection of individual rights. Liberalism promotes dialogue, negotiation, and the rule of law as means to resolve disputes.

  **John:** Schmitt criticizes this approach, arguing that liberalism misunderstands the nature of politics by attempting to depoliticize it. He believes that by focusing on individual rights and economic interests, liberal societies ignore the fundamental conflicts that define political life.

  **Emily:** He goes so far as to suggest that liberalism is inherently weak because it cannot adequately address existential threats. In times of crisis, when decisive action is required, liberalism's commitment to procedural norms and pluralism becomes a hindrance.

  **John:** To illustrate his point, Schmitt points to situations where a sovereign must make exceptional decisions to protect the state. He introduces the concept of the "state of exception," where normal legal frameworks are suspended in response to extraordinary threats.

  **Emily:** In Schmitt's view, the sovereign is the one who decides on the exceptionâ€”that is, who determines when it's necessary to override the law to ensure the survival of the political community.

  **John:** This raises serious concerns about authoritarianism and the potential for abuse of power. Schmitt's ideas have been associated with justifying dictatorial regimes, and indeed, his own association with the Nazi Party tarnishes his legacy.

  **Emily:** It's crucial to approach his work critically, acknowledging both the insights it may offer and the dangers it presents. So, let's consider what we can learn from Schmitt's critique without endorsing his more problematic aspects.

  **John:** One of the key takeaways is his emphasis on the realities of conflict and the limitations of liberalism in addressing existential threats. Schmitt challenges us to consider whether liberal societies are prepared to defend themselves against enemies who do not play by the same rules.

  **Emily:** This is particularly relevant in the context of terrorism and non-state actors who reject liberal values and employ tactics that liberal societies find difficult to counter within their own legal and ethical frameworks.

  **John:** For example, liberal democracies may struggle with how to handle groups that use violence to achieve their aims, especially when those groups are not deterred by conventional means or diplomatic efforts.

  **Emily:** Schmitt would argue that in such cases, decisive action may be necessary, even if it means suspending certain liberal principles. This poses a dilemma for liberal societies: How do they defend themselves without compromising their core values?

  **John:** It's a challenging question. If a society abandons its principles in the face of threats, does it risk becoming the very thing it seeks to oppose?

  **Emily:** Exactly. There's a danger that by adopting illiberal measures, a liberal society could erode the very freedoms and rights it aims to protect. This is sometimes referred to as the "paradox of tolerance," where unlimited tolerance may lead to the rise of intolerant forces that ultimately destroy the tolerant society.

  **John:** So, while Schmitt highlights real concerns about the vulnerabilities of liberalism, his proposed solutions may be problematic. Embracing the friend-enemy distinction as the basis of politics can lead to perpetual conflict and the suppression of dissent.

  **Emily:** It also risks dehumanizing the "enemy," making it easier to justify extreme measures against them. This can have dire consequences for human rights and the rule of law.

  **John:** In contrast to Schmitt, liberal thinkers argue that by upholding principles of justice, due process, and individual rights, societies can maintain their integrity even in the face of threats.

  **Emily:** They contend that compromising these principles undermines the moral authority and legitimacy of the state, potentially fueling further conflict and radicalization.

  **John:** So, how can liberal societies address the challenges that Schmitt raises without abandoning their core values?

  **Emily:** One approach is to strengthen institutions and legal frameworks that can adapt to new threats while preserving fundamental rights. This may involve updating laws to address issues like cyber warfare, terrorism, and other modern challenges.

  **John:** Additionally, fostering resilience within society can help. This includes promoting social cohesion, education, and critical thinking skills that enable citizens to resist extremist ideologies.

  **Emily:** International cooperation is also key. By working with other nations, liberal societies can share intelligence, coordinate responses, and address the root causes of conflicts.

  **John:** It's important to recognize that while Schmitt's critique highlights potential weaknesses, it doesn't necessarily invalidate liberalism. Instead, it can prompt a re-examination and strengthening of liberal principles to better withstand challenges.

  **Emily:** Moreover, we can question Schmitt's assumption that the friend-enemy distinction is the inevitable basis of politics. Alternative models emphasize collaboration, mutual interests, and the potential for peaceful coexistence.

  **John:** For instance, the European Union represents an attempt to transcend historical enmities and create a political community based on shared values and cooperation.

  **Emily:** While not without its challenges, such examples suggest that politics doesn't have to be defined solely by conflict.

  **John:** Another point to consider is the role of dialogue and understanding in resolving conflicts. By engaging with adversaries and addressing underlying grievances, it's possible to reduce tensions without resorting to extreme measures.

  **Emily:** This doesn't mean being naive about threats but seeking comprehensive strategies that combine security measures with efforts to build trust and address root causes.

  **John:** In this context, Schmitt's emphasis on the inevitability of conflict may be overly deterministic. Human history includes both episodes of intense conflict and periods of relative peace and cooperation.

  **Emily:** Thiel's essay uses Schmitt's ideas to challenge us to think critically about the assumptions of liberalism, especially in the face of unconventional threats. But it doesn't necessarily endorse Schmitt's conclusions.

  **John:** Instead, it encourages a nuanced approach that acknowledges the realities of conflict while striving to uphold liberal values.

  **Emily:** So, what can we learn from Schmitt? Perhaps the importance of being vigilant and prepared to defend our societies, but also the necessity of balancing security with the preservation of fundamental rights.

  **John:** It's a delicate balance, requiring wisdom and foresight from leaders and citizens alike.

  **Emily:** As we reflect on these ideas, it's important to consider how they apply to current global challenges, such as terrorism, rising authoritarianism, and ideological polarization.

  **John:** In addressing these issues, we might look for strategies that strengthen democratic institutions, promote inclusivity, and foster a shared sense of purpose.

  **Emily:** Education plays a crucial role here. By equipping individuals with the tools to critically evaluate information and engage constructively with others, we can build more resilient societies.

  **John:** Additionally, promoting dialogue across cultural and ideological divides can help reduce misunderstandings and prevent the dehumanization that Schmitt's friend-enemy distinction can entail.

  **Emily:** Ultimately, engaging with Schmitt's critique can deepen our understanding of liberalism's challenges and inspire us to develop more robust responses.

  **John:** It's about confronting uncomfortable questions and seeking solutions that align with our values.

  **Emily:** As we continue our exploration, we'll turn to Leo Strauss, who offers another perspective on these issues. Strauss sought to return to classical political philosophy to address the shortcomings of modern thought.

  **John:** We'll examine his ideas on esoteric writing, the importance of fundamental questions, and how his approach differs from both Locke and Schmitt.

  **Emily:** Strauss's work provides a bridge between ancient and modern philosophy, offering insights into how we might navigate the complexities of contemporary life.

  **John:** It's sure to be a fascinating discussion, so stay tuned as we delve deeper into "The Straussian Moment" and its implications for our understanding of politics and philosophy.

  **Emily:** Before we wrap up this chapter, I think it's important to address the ethical considerations of engaging with thinkers like Schmitt.

  **John:** Absolutely. Schmitt's association with the Nazi regime and his justifications for authoritarianism cannot be overlooked. It's crucial to approach his work with a critical eye and awareness of its historical context.

  **Emily:** Engaging with controversial ideas doesn't mean endorsing them. Instead, it allows us to understand different perspectives and strengthen our own arguments.

  **John:** By critically examining Schmitt's critique of liberalism, we can identify potential vulnerabilities and work to address them without compromising our values.

  **Emily:** It's also an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to principles like human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.

  **John:** Agreed. As we move forward, we'll consider how Strauss's ideas offer alternative ways of thinking about these challenges.

  **Emily:** We'll explore his belief in the importance of returning to fundamental questions and how his concept of esoteric writing relates to the dissemination of philosophical ideas.

  **John:** This will help us understand how classical philosophy might inform our responses to modern dilemmas.

  **Emily:** So, join us next time as we continue this thought-provoking journey through "The Straussian Moment."
